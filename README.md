# Predictive Model for Insurance Claims
Develop a model for insurance claim likelihood, addressing class imbalance.
## Overview
In this project, our task is to develop and evaluate a predictive model that accurately identifies the likelihood of insurance claims, despite the inherent class imbalance in the dataset. The model should maintain high predictive accuracy across both classes, ensuring that insurers can effectively assess risk and allocate resources.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical data on insurance claims, including information about the policyholders, their demographics, past claim history, and other relevant features. The dataset is sourced from statso.io.

## Objectives
Develop a predictive model that accurately predicts the likelihood of insurance claims.
Address the class imbalance issue in the dataset to ensure the model maintains high predictive accuracy across both classes (claims vs. non-claims).

Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Fine-tune the model parameters and explore different algorithms to improve its performance.
Provide insights and recommendations based on the model's predictions to help insurers better assess risk and allocate resources effectively.

## Methodology
We will employ a machine learning approach to develop the predictive model, utilizing techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. To address the class imbalance issue, we will explore techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using class weights during model training. Model evaluation will be conducted using cross-validation and appropriate performance metrics.
